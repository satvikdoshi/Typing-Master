**Typing Master**

Typing Master is a desktop application developed using Python, Tkinter, and threading, designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. The application allows users to test their typing skills by typing a given set of text and displays real-time statistics such as typing speed (WPM), accuracy, and incorrectly typed words.

**Features**
1. Real-time typing speed tracking: Displays the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) as the user types.
2. Accuracy calculation: Calculates the accuracy based on the correctly typed words.
3. Error detection: Highlights incorrect words and shows the number of typing errors made.
4. Customizable typing text: Users can change the text they wish to practice typing on.
5. Simple user interface: Developed using Tkinter for a clean and easy-to-use graphical interface.

**Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language used for the development.
- **Tkinter**: Python library for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Threading**: For managing multiple processes (such as typing and real-time calculation of WPM).
- **ttkthemes**: Used for styling the Tkinter interface.

**Prerequisites**
To run the application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (Tkinter and ttkthemes)
- 
**You can install the required libraries using pip**
- pip install ttkthemes
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the project directory
- Run the main Python file

The application window will open, and you can start typing to test your typing speed and accuracy.

**How It Works**

Once the application starts, you are presented with a text area where you can type the text displayed above.
As you type, the application will measure your words per minute (WPM) and calculate the percentage of accuracy in real-time.
Incorrect words will be highlighted, and you will be notified of errors made while typing.
At the end of the test, a summary of your performance will be shown, including WPM, accuracy, and error count.

**Motivation**

This project was developed as part of a personal endeavor to improve my typing speed while providing a tool for others to enhance their skills. Typing Master is inspired by the need to accurately measure typing performance and highlight areas for improvement.

**Future Enhancements**

- Add more typing test modes (paragraph, random words).
- Implement a leaderboard to track users' high scores.
- Option to select different difficulty levels based on text complexity.
- Add the ability to track typing progress over time.
